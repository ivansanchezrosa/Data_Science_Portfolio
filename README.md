- ### Graph Analysis

     - [Bitcoin graph analysis and halving price](https://github.com/ivansanchezrosa/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Graph%20Analysis/Halving%20y%20bitcoin/Halving%20y%20precio%20bitcoin.ipynb):In this project we will carry out an analysis of social networks, where the object of study will be to analyze the most influential accounts that speak on a process called halving and its effect on the price of bitcoin. 
     


- ### Machine Learning
   
     - [ML Supervised Boston Houses](https://github.com/ivansanchezrosa/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Boston-Houses/ML_Boston_Houses_Prices.ipynb):In this project our objective is create a model using linear regression to predict the houses price. 
     - [ML Unsupervised World Happinest Report](https://github.com/ivansanchezrosa/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Boston-Houses/ML_Boston_Houses_Prices.ipynb):In this project shows visualization of data using Choropleth maps. Further, it tries to cluster the data using few clustering algorithms including K-means and Guassian Mixture Model based on several factors such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, corruption etc.
